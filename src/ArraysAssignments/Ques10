Ques10. Can you store String in an array of Integer in Java?
        Compile time error or runtime exception?
Ans. No, we cannot store String in an array of Integer in Java , otherwise, there is
     no point of declaring the data-type of Arrays during its initialization.
     It will show Compile Time error.
     For example: int[] a = new int[10]; clearly specifies that integer has to be
     stored in an array and not any other type.
