 * Q2. (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes)                *
 * Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. *
 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,            *
 * address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status         *
 * (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An  *
 * employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined   *
 * in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty    *
 * member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the   *
 * toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name  *
